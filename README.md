# React Data Fetching Application

## Overview

In this project, I have created a React application that demonstrates data fetching using a custom React hook. The project includes a component named `FetchData` that retrieves and displays data from an API endpoint using the `useFetch` custom hook.

## Features

- **Custom Hook**: `useFetch` encapsulates the logic for fetching data from a specified URL.
- **Component**: `FetchData` is responsible for rendering the fetched data onto the UI.
- **Data Display**: Uses the `map` method to render each item with attributes like name, importance, benefits, and best time to intake.
- **Modular and Reusable**: The `useFetch` hook allows for easy data fetching from various API endpoints.
